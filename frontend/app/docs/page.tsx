                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>
                  ADERA Finance is a decentralized lending protocol focused on
                  improving borrower safety and pricing fairness. Instead of
                  static borrowing rates and passive dashboards, ADERA Finance
                  introduces an agentic system that proactively monitors risk
                  and notifies users before positions become fragile.

                <h2>Protocol Overview</h2>
                <p>
                  The protocol is composed of a lending pool smart contract,
                  oracle-fed pricing, borrower credit inputs, and an AI risk
                  monitoring layer. Borrowers deposit supported collateral
                  assets, open debt positions, and receive adaptive APR based on
                  credit signals.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The core objective is capital efficiency with reduced
                  liquidation surprises through continuous monitoring and
                  proactive communication.
                </p>
              </section>

              <section id="lending-borrowing" className="scroll-mt-24">
                <h2>Lending & Borrowing</h2>
                <p>
                  ADERA Finance follows an overcollateralized model. Users first
                  deposit approved collateral and then borrow assets within risk
                  constraints determined by collateral factor and current health
                  factor.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Borrow positions can be repaid partially or fully at any time.
                  Collateral can be withdrawn as long as post-withdrawal health
                  remains above the liquidation threshold.
                </p>
                <pre>
                  <code>{`// Position health approximation
healthFactor = (collateralValue * liquidationThreshold) / debtValue

// Borrowing power approximation
maxBorrow = collateralValue * collateralFactor - currentDebt`}</code>
                </pre>
              </section>

              <section id="credit-score-model" className="scroll-mt-24">
                <h2>Credit Score Model</h2>
                <p>
                  ADERA Finance assigns borrower APR ranges using credit-derived
                  inputs such as repayment consistency, utilization behavior,
                  and historical risk profile. Better credit behavior can
                  result in improved borrowing terms compared with baseline
                  rates.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This framework encourages responsible repayment behavior while
                  preserving transparent protocol economics.
                </p>

              <section id="oracle-system" className="scroll-mt-24">
                <h2>Oracle System</h2>
                <p>
                  Price feeds are consumed through oracle integrations to update
                  collateral valuation and debt exposure. Oracle updates are used
                  directly in health factor computation and risk agent signals.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Fallback handling and heartbeat checks are enforced to reduce
                  stale-price risk during high volatility periods.
                </p>
              </section>

              <section id="ai-risk-agent" className="scroll-mt-24">
                <h2>AI Risk Agent</h2>
                <p>
                  ADERA Finance&apos;s risk monitoring agent tracks borrower
                  positions continuously and scores liquidation proximity. If a
                  position crosses configurable risk thresholds, the agent
                  emits in-app alerts and proactive email notifications.
                </p>

                <h2>Smart Contracts</h2>
                <p>
                  Smart contracts manage deposits, borrows, repayments,
                  withdrawals, collateral factors, and liquidation logic.
                  Contracts are designed to keep accounting deterministic and
                  isolate privileged actions behind explicit access controls.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Integration points include token contracts, oracle adapters,
                  and risk-agent event listeners.

                <h2>Security</h2>
                <p>
                  Security posture includes contract review, role minimization,
                  tested failure paths, and monitoring for abnormal activity.
                  Governance actions should be protected by multisig execution
                  and operational runbooks.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Recommended production hardening includes formal verification
                  for critical logic, independent audits, and staged rollout
                  policies.
